# Visualization and analysis of web engine data
Data preprocessing and visualization are important skills of managing Internet services such as search engines and online social networks. In this task, we are going deal with two weeks of search logs from a large search engine and learn some practical techniques to analyze the data.   
The data has been given during the course of Advanced Network Management (Fall 2019) of Tsinghua University.  

In this project have been calculated and displayed the results of the following jobs:  
- Calculate the average SRT of every 10 minutes, and plot the SRT with a line chart (x axis for date time and y axis for the average SRT). - Calculate the average of each SRT component of every 10 minute, and plot the four SRT components together with a stacked area chart (x axis for date time and y axis for time) and also a 100% stacked area chart (y axis for the percentage). 
- Plot the CDF (Cumulative distribution function) chart of SRT. 
- Plot the CDF chart of #Images. 
- Count the number of queries (also called page views or PVs) of each minute, and plot the minute-level PVs with a line chart (x axis for date time and y axis for the PVs). 
- Count the PVs of each province, and plot it with a histogram chart (x axis for province and y axis for PVs). 
- Count the PVs of each UA, and plot it with a pie chart (show the percentages in the chart).
